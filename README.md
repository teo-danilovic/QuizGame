**Your game’s name**: 


My game is called 'QuizMaster!' and it is a question and answer style game, with two themes: Harry Potter and Greek Mythology. The player is able to choose which theme they wish to play, after which they will see 5 multiple choice questions. Once they have finished, they see their score, and are able to play another theme or play the same theme again. 

The reason I chose this game is because the logic of it seemed the most clear to me at this stage, and I chose the themes because I am a huge Harry Potter Fan and also love Greek Mythology! 

P.S. Make sure your sound is turned up as both themes have some background music!


**Getting started**:

Link to Planning Materials: https://www.notion.so/autogenai/1st-Project-15191820e73c80e6bce9f590d3edb023?pvs=4 

**Technologies used**: 

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.

**Next steps**: 

With more time i would add more themes, more questions, and more choices for answers. 

I would make it so that the score of each theme is stored and you can get a 'general knowledge' score which tells you how you did on ALL the themes. 

I would add background images for each page and add dynamic effects on the pages.
