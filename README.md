**Your gameâ€™s name**: 


My game is called 'QuizMaster!' and it is a question and answer style game, with two themes: Harry Potter and Greek Mythology. The player is able to choose which theme they wish to play, after which they will see 5 multiple choice questions. Once they have finished, they see their score, and are able to play another theme or play the same theme again. 

The reason I chose this game is because the log of it seemed the most clear to me at this stage, and I chose the themes because I am a huge Harry Potter Fan and also love Greek Mythology! 


**Getting started**: 
Include a link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important. This should also contain a link to your planning materials.


**Attributions**: This section should include links to any external resources (such as libraries or assets) you used to develop your application that require attribution. You can exclude this section if it does not apply to your application.

**Technologies used**: 

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.

**Next steps**: 

With more time i would add more themes, more questions, and more choices for answers. I would make it so that the score of each theme is stored and you can get a 'general knowledge' score which tells you how you did on ALL the themes. 

I would add background images for each page and add dynamic effects on the pages
